# dimelo
dimelo is a python package and command-line tool for analysis of DiMeLo-seq &amp; nanopore modified base data.

this dev fork, dimelo_arbitrary_basemod_dev, is a temporary fork created to facilitate development and testing for non mA/CpG base modifications while I don't have full permissions for the streets lab github, which may be resolved rapidly. the intention is to merge this back into the core dimelo package when ready, either to continue on a branch there or to integrate the finalized chnages, and then deprecate this temporary fork. thus this version is not intended for production use.
